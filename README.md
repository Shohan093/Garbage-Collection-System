# Garbage-Collection-System

Let's consider the types of garbage.
- Biodegradable
- Non-Biodegradable
    - recyclable
    - non-recyclable

Design a smart garbage collection system. The system has installed a bin in every source
(source-bin) mentioned above (1 to 5). Those bins are connected to the city-corporation's
garbage management plant bins (GMP-bin) by underground tunnels. A suction mechanism
transports the garbage from the source-bin to the GMP-bin. After collecting the garbage,
GMP-bin allocates them to 2 separate bins (Biodegradable/ B-bin and Non-biodegradable/
NB-bin). Non-biodegradable bin (NB-bin) further separates them to 2 separate bins (Recyclable/
R-bin and Non-recyclable/ NR-bin). Contents of the bins are then dumped to the plant for
processing.
